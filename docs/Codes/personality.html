            <h2>MY INSPIRATION: SATORU GOJO</h2>
            <div class="hero-content">
                <p>Satoru Gojo, a fictional character from the popular manga series "Jujutsu Kaisen", is my chosen hero. He exudes an unwavering self-assurance that's both admirable and infectious. His confident demeanor inspires those around him, particularly his students.</p>
                <blockquote>"Throughout Heaven and Earth, I alone am the Honored One" - Satoru Gojo</blockquote>
                <p>This quote resonates deeply with me as it encapsulates the spirit of enlightenment and confidence in one's own strength. Gojo being pushed to his limits comes to a realization in a dire situation that he is facing, finally submits himself as the Honored One.</p>
                <blockquote>"Would you lose?" - Student</blockquote>
                <blockquote>"Nah I'd Win" - Satoru Gojo</blockquote>
                <p>I chose Gojo has my hero because despite the odds being stacked against him, he reassures those who look to him that he will not fail.</p>

                <img src="/Assets/test.jpg" alt="Personality Test Results">
                <h3>Reflection on Personality Test Results</h3>
                <p>After taking the Keirsey Temperament Sorter, I found the results to be both insightful and thought-provoking. The test identified me as an "Guardian" personality type, characterized by duty, humbleness, and hardworking.</p>
                <p>While I believe this assessment captures some key aspects of my personality, particularly my desire to provide for my loves ones and responsible nature, I also recognize the limitations of such tests. Some questions didn't really apply to me.</p>
                <p>I see this assessment as a starting point for self-reflection rather than a definitive label. It highlighted areas where I can leverage my strengths, such as my ability to see the bigger picture, and areas where I can grow, like growing my social skills.</p>
                <p>Moving forward, I plan to use these insights to inform my personal development goals, while remaining open to different experiences and challenges that will continue to shape my character both academically and personally.</p>
